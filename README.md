# Ohmyfood - Reservation and Ordering 

This site was completed with HTML, SCSS, and CSS only.

I was directed to recreate the site from mock-ups and a project brief. Mock-ups were mobile only, but did include animations for the menu loading and the item selection animations. Tablet and desktop versions were also created using the project brief and mobile site as a guideline.
