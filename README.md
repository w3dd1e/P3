# Ohmyfood - Reservation and Ordering 
Project #3 Web Development - 

This site was completed with HTML, SCSS, and CSS in VSCode and processed commits using Git via Linux on Windows with WSL.

I was directed to recreate the site from mock-ups and a project brief from the fictional CTO. Mock-ups were mobile only, but did include animations for the menu loading and the item selection animations. Tablet and desktop versions were also created using the project brief and mobile site as a guideline.
